# USER STORIES

- as a member of marketing research team I want to give a user the possibility to change number of displayed items, so that they could have better selection;

- as a developer I want to try to create appealing animated design to challenge my css skills;

- as a user I want to see how many votes I have left;

- as a developer I want to change pictures behavior when there's no votesleft, so that user would understand it without even looking at numbers;
