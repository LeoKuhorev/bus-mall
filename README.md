Code Fellows 201 Bus-Mall Project

Link to deployed page: https://leokuhorev.github.io/bus-mall/

FEATURES:

- users are given certain amount of votes (stored in *VOTES* variable in app.js) that they need to spend by clicking on the item they like the most;
- amount of items per page can be changed in the dropdown;
- no item matches the ones besides it or the ones that were shown immediately before (console logs dynamically changing array (depending on item per page value) with unique indexes for each item);
- after users run out of votes the app shows them their favorite item (based on votes/views ratio) and list of the items they picked;
