Code Fellows 201 Bus-Mall Project

Link to deployed page: https://leokuhorev.github.io/bus-mall/

FEATURES:

- users are given certain amount of votes (stored in *VOTES* variable in app.js) that they need to spend to pick the item they like the most by clicking on the picture;
- amount of item per page can be changed in the dropdown;
- no item matches the ones besides it or the ones that were shown immediately before (console logs dynamically changing array (depending on item per page value) with unique indexes for each item);
- after users run out of votes the list of the items they clicked on is displayed;
